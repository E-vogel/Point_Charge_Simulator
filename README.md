# Point_Charge_Simulator

This MATLAB code simulates the electric force lines generated by point charges in a 2D space. Users can interactively add positive and negative charges to observe the resulting field dynamics.

## Running the Simulation

1. Run the script in MATLAB:
    ```matlab
    Point_Charge
    ```

2. The simulation window will open.

3. Click and drag the positive or negative charge on the right into the window.

4. Escape key to end simulation

## Example Output

Here's an example of what the simulation output looks like:
